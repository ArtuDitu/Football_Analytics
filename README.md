# Football Analytics

In this repo I learn and showcase data analyst skills.

The projects are listed in the chronological order (the current one at the top)

# Get data and pre-process it

To obtain data I use library [worldfootballR](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR) that allows to scrape data from <https://fbref.com/en/>.

My goal is to get data for 7 best (relative) European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Eredivise, Liga Portugal).
